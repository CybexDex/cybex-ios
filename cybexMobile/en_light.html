Project Information<br>All information, data, whitepapers and other materials (“information”) concerning issuers and their projects is provided by issuers individually and that such information may contain risks and flaws, and issuer is solely responsible for the accuracy of all statements it has made and information it has provided. Cybex is merely a platform where you can obtain issuers and projects information and carry out transactions, and cannot control the quality, safety or legality of the projects, the truthfulness and accuracy of the issuer’s information, or the capabilities of various issuers in fulfilling their obligations stipulated in transactions. Cybex makes no representations and disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to accuracy, timeliness, completeness merchantabilities or fitness of any information and accept no liability (whether in tort or contract or otherwise) for any loss or damage arising from any inaccuracy or omission or from any decision, action or non-action based on or in reliance upon information.</li><li> 5.

You should immediately cease using our platform and Services if you were not legally allowed or not meet the qualifications required by those rules and laws.</li><li> 6.  Identifications Information<br>Although Cybex is a decentralized platform of digital-asset transaction, we may still need to carry out “know your customer” survey (hereinafter be referred to as “KYC”) subject to certain relevant requirements of applicable laws or regulations.

Validity<br>Since Cybex is a decentralized trading platform, if the users do not participate in crowdfunding through the official channel (front-end entry on ETO web page) as we require and offer, for instance, it can also be directly transferred to the crowdfunding address by means of API, which is temporarily impossible to be prevented at the technical level. However, as operator of the platform, we do not recognize the amount of crowdfunding through unfair channels as effective and do not refund any amount of crowdfunding through informal channels.

The value of listed asset hinges heavily on the popularity of its project. The worst-case scenario is that listed assets may even remain marginalized in a long term, appealing to only a minimal portion of the users. Trading of listed assets merely depends on the consensus on its value between the relevant market participants. Cybex will not (nor has the obligation or responsibility to) stabilize or otherwise affect and make no guarantee about any listed asset’s market price.</li><li> 9.  Fluctuations<br>The participation in or purchase and selling of Digital Assets involves significant risk which is not generally shared with official fiat currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most fiat currencies, these Digital Assets are based on technology and trust.

The prices of Digital Assets may suffer a large fluctuation in value and may become worthless. Cybex will not (nor has the obligation or responsibility to) stabilize or otherwise affect and make no guarantee about any digital asset’s market price. You should carefully assess whether your objectives, financial situation, needs, experience and tolerance for risk is suitable for participating, buying or selling Digital Assets.</li></ol><h3 class="center title-sub">&nbsp;Scope of Responsibility and Limitation of Liability </h3><ol><li>1.
