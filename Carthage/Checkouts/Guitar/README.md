## About
This library seeks to add common string manipulation functions, including common regular expression capabilities, that are needed in both mobile and server-side development, but are missing in Swift's Standard Library.

The full documentation can be found at http://www.sabintsev.com/Guitar/.

Guitar is also part of [Swift's Source Compatibility Suite](https://swift.org/source-compatibility/#current-list-of-projects).

## Features
- [x] Boolean Functions (`isAlpha`, `isNumeric`, `isUppercase`, etc.)
- [x] Case Functions (`camelCased`, `pascalCased`, `kebabCased`, etc.)
- [x] Latinization Functions (`.latinized()`, `.withoutAccents()`)
- [x] Padding Functions (`padLeft`, `padRight`, `pad`)
- [x] Regular Expressions (with Common Patterns Built-in)

### Sherlocked

A small set of functions offered by Guitar were removed in v0.3.0 of the library as Apple added many of these features to the Swift 4 language (aka, [Sherlocking](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sherlocked)). The functions that were removed were: `first, last, length, prefixed, suffixed, trimLeft, trimRight, truncated`. The `reversed` function was renamed to `reversedString` as it acts slightly differently than Swift's built-in `reversed` function.

## Usage Examples

### Regular Expression
- `Guitar` makes it easier to use Regular Expressions to test and evaluate `String` objects.
- `Guitar.Chord` enumerates common regular expressions and they are located in _GuitarChord.swift_.
- _GuitarCommon.swift_ contains a list of convenience methods for common regular expression evaluations and tests, such as checking the string to determine if it's a valid email address.

#### Initialization

```swift
Guitar(pattern: String) // A custom regular expression with which to initialize Guitar.

Guitar(chord: Guitar.Chord) // A common regular expression with which to initialize Guitar.
```

#### Methods

`evaluateForRanges(::)` returns an array of ranges, `[Range<String.Index>]`, that match a specific regular expression.
```swift
Guitar(chord: .firstCharacter).evaluateForRanges(from: "Hello world") // [Range(Swift.String.CharacterView.Index(_base: Swift.String.UnicodeScalarView.Index(_position: 0), _countUTF16: 1)..<Swift.String.CharacterView.Index(_base: Swift.String.UnicodeScalarView.Index(_position: 1), _countUTF16: 1)), Range(Swift.String.CharacterView.Index(_base: Swift.String.UnicodeScalarView.Index(_position: 6), _countUTF16: 1)..<Swift.String.CharacterView.Index(_base: Swift.String.UnicodeScalarView.Index(_position: 7), _countUTF16: 1))]
```

`evaluateForStrings(::)` returns an array of strings, `[String]`, that match a specific regular expression.
```swift
Guitar(chord: .firstCharacter).evaluateForStrings(from: "Hello world") // ["H", "w"]
```

`test(::)` evaluates a string with a specific regular expression. `true` is returned if matches are found in the string. Otherwise, `false` is returned.
```swift
Guitar(chord: .email).test(string: "hello@world.com") // `true`
```

### String Extension

This library also adds dozens of methods via `String` extensions that are missing in the Swift Standard Library or not easily accessible on the `String` class. Examples of each new method can be found in the [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy)-powered [documentation](http://sabintsev.com/Guitar/Extensions/String.html).

More specific examples can be found in the
[tests](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Guitar/tree/master/Tests/GuitarTests) folder.
